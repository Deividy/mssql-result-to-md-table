mssql-result-to-md-table
===


Tired of formating all the results of a SQL Server query into a markdown table? Well, well, well your problems are gone!

Just save the query result in your file system (with the tedious right-click, copy with headers) and:

```
npx mssql-result-to-md-table /path/to/my/sqlresult
```
